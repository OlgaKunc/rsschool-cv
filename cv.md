# Summary
I graduated the Pharmaceutical faculty of Vitebsk State medical university this year. I used to think that it is impossible for me to become a developer, because i haven't ever learnt html, css, JS before. Not long ago I started to look for a new area for self-development and found out that I'm really into code-writing.That is how I appeared in Rsschool.For now I don't have any baggage of knowledge in front/end-developing, but I'm passionately want to have one.
